# Week 3 Homework

This week, you'll create a Rails app that can deal a hand of poker.

## Requirements

Build a Rails application that can mimic or extend the functionality of this page:

* http://www.entr925.com/poker

Fancy graphics aren't required.  You can use text instead of images if you want.

Your app must:

* Support this url: http://localhost:3000/poker
* Show five unique cards, randomly chosen from a typical 52-card deck
* Show a link that will refresh the page

## Remember these key ideas:

* Remember the RCAV recipe!
* The Array class provides methods you might find handy
